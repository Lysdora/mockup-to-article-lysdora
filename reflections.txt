Your response goes here!
* What new skills have you learned?

I learned to concentrate more and organize my work, I did not discover new tag because I already studied the html in books.

* What has been easy?

The mock-up was quite simple, adding image, paragraph.

  * What has been difficult?
  
  For the strikethrough text I used the span tag with style, I hesitated a lot before submitting my assignment, I usually do it with a css sheet.
I try to improve and this first work is genial! A bit hard but it happens if we think well.
   
 * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
  
  I searched on google for the strikethrough because I did not know how to do it, I came across the mozilla mdn page and I succeeded.
   The search on google is the best friend of the web developer!
